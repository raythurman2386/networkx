## Introduction
NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. This repository aims to provide tutorials, examples, and projects to help you get started and advance your expertise with NetworkX.

## Getting Started
To get started with NetworkX, you need to have Python installed on your machine. We recommend using Python 3.10 or higher.

## Installation
You can install NetworkX using pip:
```bash
pip install networkx
```

Additionally, for visualization, you may want to install Matplotlib and other useful libraries:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```

## Examples
Below are a few examples to help you get started with NetworkX:

### Basic Graph
This example demonstrates how to create a basic graph:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create an empty graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes
G.add_node(1)
G.add_nodes_from([2, 3, 4])

# Add edges
G.add_edge(1, 2)
G.add_edges_from([(2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)])

# Draw the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

### Graph Algorithms
This example showcases some common graph algorithms:

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a graph
G = nx.cycle_graph(4)

# Compute shortest paths
print("Shortest path between nodes 0 and 3:")
print(nx.shortest_path(G, source=0, target=3))

# Compute degree centrality
print("Degree centrality of the graph:")
print(nx.degree_centrality(G))
```

### Visualization
This example illustrates how to visualize a graph with additional attributes:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4.2)
G.add_edge(2, 3, weight=6.1)

pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
edges = nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edge_color='black')
nodes = nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_color='red', node_size=500)
labels = nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)

plt.show()
```

## Projects
Explore or add sophisticated projects that utilize NetworkX for analyzing various types of real-world networks, such as social networks, transportation networks, and more.

To add your projects, create a folder in the `projects` directory and include your code, data, and a brief description.
